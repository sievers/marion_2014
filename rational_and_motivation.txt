Emission and absorption due to the 21-cm spin flip transition of
neutral atomic Hydrogen (referred to as HI by astronomers) have been proposed as valuable tools to probe
the physics of the Universe at early times.  Experiments studying the
early universe through the 21-cm transition are of two kinds: mapping
experiments that compute the power spectrum of 21-cm fluctuations and
all-sky experiments that measure the averaged 21-cm brightness
temperature. These are also known as ‘global signal
experiments’. Mapping experiments include the Precision Array for
Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER - AJ 139, 1468), the Giant Metrewave
Radio Telescope Epoch of Reionization (GMRT-EoR AIPC 1035,75), the Low
Frequency Array for Radio Astronomy (LOFAR - A&A 550, 136), the Murchison
Widefield Array (MWA - PASP 122, 1353), the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array
(HERA, recently awarded seed funding by the US National Science
Foundation for construction in South Africa) and the planned Square
Kilometer Array (SKA). All-sky 
experiments include the Experiment to Detect the Global EoR Signature
(EDGES), Large-Aperture Experiment to Detect the Dark Ages (LEDA) and the proposed Dark Ages Radio Explorer (DARE).

The first stars to form are composed of primordial elements. These
stars, called Population III.1, are thought to form in dark matter minihalos
of mass ≈ 1-100 million times the mass of the sun at a redshift z ≈
20-30 (100-200 million years after the big bang) and provide ultraviolet
illumination of the HI.  These objects are much smaller than the ones
that dominate the universe today, as the universe was so young that
today's typical galaxies had not yet had time to form.  Supernovae
from these short lived, massive stars enriched the Universe with heavy
elements for the first time and ionized neutral hydrogen, paving the way for the subsequent
generations of lower mass stars and planets that we see today.

Formation of the first stars is thus a subject of broad impact, but it
is difficult to constrain these models due to the absence of
observations at high redshifts.  One peculiarity of hydrogen is that
the alignment/anti-alignment of the nuclear and electron spins is
extremely stable, and, if undisturbed, will change only on timescales
of millions of years.  So, the temperature inferred by measuring the
ratio of aligned to anti-aligned spins  (the "spin temperature" or T_s) can be very different from
the actual temperature of the gas (they kinetic temperature or
"T_k").  Formation of the first stars results
in the production of Lyman-alpha photons (emitted when electrons in
hydrogen atoms jump from their first excited state back to the ground state), which are efficient in coupling
the spin (T_s ) and kinetic (T_k ) temperatures of HI through the
Wouthuysen-Field mechanism. At z ≈ 20-30 the neutral gas kinetic
temperature T_k is proportional to (1 + z)^2 is well below the CMB temperature
(T_CMB). The Wouthuysen-Field mechanism sets T_s = T_k , and predicts
a significant trough in the 21-cm brightness temperature (T_b, the
quantity actually measured by telescopes) around the redshift of first
star formation, with T_b proportional to (T_s − 
T_CMB )/T_S ≈ −T_CMB/T_k. This value is expected to be in the range of
0.1 K.  Later, heating of the gas by X-rays or
gamma-rays sets T_s=T_k >> T_CMB. The brightness temperature of the
hyperfine transition then enters the emission saturation
regime where T_b is small and positive. Later
the 21-cm brightness decreases to zero as the Universe reionizes and
there is no more neutral hydrogen left. The
processes described above result in a trough in the 21-cm brightness
temperature spectrum. Detection and measurement of this trough
requires the measurement of an all-sky spectrum, which is the goal of
this proposed work. Such a measurement will provide information on the
properties of the first stars and X-ray sources. (Sample models of the
signal we are searching for can be seen in e.g. Figure 7 from the 2006
review by Furlanetto, Peng, and Briggs (PhR 433,181), amongst many
other places.)  

%Calculated 21-cm brightness spectra are shown in Fig. ?? from [?,?].

A key difficulty for all these experiments is the much brighter
Galactic continuum emission, which must be subtracted in order to
measure the 21-cm flux. At the low end of the frequency range of
interest for reionization, 50 MHz, the Galactic brightness temperature at high Galactic
latitude is about 5000K. The synchrotron spectrum declines as ∼ ν^−2.5
and at the high end, 250 MHz, the sky brightness has fallen to about
80 K. Underneath this sloping foreground lies the 10-200 mK features
due to 21-cm emission and absorption.

The Galactic synchrotron emission mechanism is believed to produce a
spectrum that is quite featureless apart from a smooth power law,
allowing detection of the features we seek. However, to adequately
remove even a smooth power law the brightness itself must be measured
with a precision of a part in 100,000. This very precise calibration of the
spectrometer is needed across about an octave of frequency. The
calibration strategy that has worked best for us so far is to use the
daily variation of the Galactic brightness as the Milky Way rises and
sets as a an on-sky calibration source. We assume the spectrum of the Galactic emission is
much smoother than the 21-cm signal we seek, and remove a low order
polynomial in log(frequency) vs. log(intensity). This technique has the advantage that the
entire system is calibrated end-to-end, without disconnecting the
antenna. The disadvantage is that we must assume the spectral
smoothness of the Galactic flux, although that appears to be a very
good description, and there is no known plausible physical mechanism
that would make the galactic emission non-smooth.

Observations from the South African sub-Antarctic islands may also
allow an exciting new cosmological measurement.  The upper atmosphere
has a layer where incoming solar radiation ionizes molecules in the
air, called the ionosphere.  At low frequencies, the ionosphere
reflects radio waves, with the cutoff frequency set by the density of
ions in the ionosphere.  This phenomenon is well known in radio
communications and is why low-frequency transmissions (like AM radio) can sometimes be
picked up from over a thousand kilometres away.  The highest frequency at
which radio waves are reflected is called the Maximum Usable Frequency
(MUF), since frequencies above that only work for line-of-sight
communications.  This also means astrophysical signals below the MUF
are reflected back into space and so cannot be observed from the
ground.  The MUF tends to be highest (worst for astronomy) where the
sun is overhead, so summer/equatorial regions have the highest MUFs.
Night is better than day, as ionized atoms recombine .  During polar winters, the lack of
sunlight means that the ionosphere substantially recombines, and the
MUF can drop considerably.  The MUF over most of the planet is in the
20-40 MHz range, but nights at Marion routinely drop to 6-7 MHz
(realtime MUF maps can be seen at
http://www.spacew.com/www/realtime.php).  This means that we may be
able to do astrophysics at frequencies that are impossible to do from
any of the major radio observatories on Earth.  We may be able to use
the 21-cm hydrogen line to observe the universe not just at redshifts
around 20, but at redshifts of 50-150, well before the first stars (we
think) when the universe is as young as 10 million years old, or less
than one thousandth of its current age (around 14 billion years
old).  Telescopes have been proposed on the moon for this redshift range
[arXiv0909.1509B (2009), A&A 525, 128 (2011), NewAR 53, 1 (2009)], but
we now believe that winter conditions in the polar regions may 
make this work possible from the surface of the earth. At
mid-latitudes, from the earth’s surface this spectral range is very
difficult to use for astronomy because of strong shortwave broadcast
signals and ionospheric reflection, so even remote sites would be
contaminated. In the winter, on the polar cap 
these broadcast signals are much weaker than at mid-latitudes, and may
be entirely absent for periods of time.  The work proposed here, at no
additional cost, would be a key step in understanding if this era of
the universe can be studied from the ground.
