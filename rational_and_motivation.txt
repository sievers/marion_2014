Emission and absorption due to the 21-cm spin flip transition of
neutral Hydrogen (HI) have been proposed as valuable tools to probe
the physics of the Universe at early times [?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?,
?]. Experiments studying the early universe through the 21-cm
transition are of two kinds: mapping experiments that compute the
power spectrum of 21-cm fluctations and all-sky experiments that
measure the averaged 21-cm brightness temperature. These are also
known as ‘global signal experiments’. Mapping experiments include the
Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER) [?, ?],
the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope Epoch of Reionization (GMRT-EoR)
[?], the Low Frequency Array for Radio Astronomy (LOFAR) [?], the
Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) [?], the Hydrogen Epoch of
Reionization Array (HERA) [?] and the planned Square Kilometer Array
(SKA) [?]. All-sky experiments include the Experiment to Detect the
Global EoR Signature (EDGES) [?], Large-Aperture Experiment to Detect
the Dark Ages (LEDA) [?]and the proposed Dark Ages Radio Explorer
(DARE) [?].

The first stars to form are composed of primordial elements. These
stars, called Pop. III.1, are thought to form in dark matter minihalos
of mass ≈ 10 6 − 10 8 M at a redshift z ≈ 20-30 [?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?,
?, ?], and provide UV illumination of the HI. Supernovae from these
3short lived, massive stars enriched the Universe with heavy elements,
paving the way for the subsequent generation of lower mass stars and
planets.

Formation of the first stars is thus a subject of broad impact, but it
is difficult to constrain these models due to the absence of
observations at high redshifts. Formation of the first stars results
in the production of Lyman-α photons, which are efficient in coupling
the spin (T s ) and kinetic (T k ) temperatures of HI through the
Wouthuysen-Field mechanism [?,?]. At z ≈ 20-30 the neutral gas kinetic
temperature T k ∝ (1 + z) 2 is well below the CMB temperature (T γ
). The Wouthuysen-Field mechanism sets T s = T k , and predicts a
significant trough in the 21-cm brightness temperature (T b ) around
the redshift of first star formation, with T b ∝ (T s − T γ )/T s ≈ −T
γ /T k . Later, heating of the gas by X-rays or γ-rays sets T s =T k T
γ . T b then the hyperfine transition enters the emission saturation
regime where the brightness temperature is small and positive. Later
the 21-cm brightness decreases to zero as the Universe reionizes. The
processes described above result in a trough in the 21-cm brightness
temperature spectrum. Detection and measurement of this trough
requires the measurement of an all-sky spectrum, which is the goal of
this proposed work. Such a measurement will provide information on the
properties of the first stars and X-ray sources. [?, ?, ?,
?]. Calculated 21-cm brightness spectra are shown in Fig. ?? from [?,
?].

A key difficulty for all these experiments is the much brighter
Galactic continuum emis- sion, which must be subtracted in order to
measure the 21-cm flux. At the low end of the frequency range of
interest, 50 MHz, the Galactic brightness temperature at high Galactic
latitude is about 5000K. The synchrotron spectrum declines as ∼ ν −2.5
and at the high end, 250 MHz, the sky brightness has fallen to about
80 K. Underneath this sloping foreground lies the 10-200 mK features
due to 21-cm emission and absorption.

The Galactic synchrotron emission mechanism is believed to produce a
spectrum that is quite featureless apart from a smooth power law,
allowing detection of the features we seek. However, to adequately
remove even a smooth power law the brightness itself must be measured
with a precision ∼ 10 −5 . This very precise calibration of the
spectrometer is needed across about an octave of frequency. The
calibration strategy that has worked best for us so far is to use the
diurnal variation of the Galactic brightness as a an on-sky
calibration source. We assume the spectrum of the Galactic emission is
much smoother than the 21-cm signal we seek, and remove a low order
polynomial in logν vs logI. This technique has the advantage that the
entire system is calibrated end-to-end, without disconnecting the
antenna. The disadvantage is that we must assume the spectral
smoothness of the Galactic flux.

Ionospheric conditions in the polar cap region may allow an exciting
new type of cosmology observation using the 21-cm (1420MHz) line
redshifted by a factor of 50 to 150 into the frequency range 10-30
MHz. Telescopes have been proposed on the moon for this redshift range

but we now believe that winter conditions in the polar regions may
make this work possible from the surface of the earth. At
mid-latitudes, from the earth’s surface this spectral range is very
difficult to use for astronomy because of strong shortwave broadcast
signals and ionospheric reflection. In the winter, on the polar cap
these broadcast signals are much weaker than at mid-latitudes, and may
be entirely absent for periods of time. In addition, the ionosphere is
transparent down to much lower frequencies than at mid-latitudes.
