Very few observations constrain models of the Dark Ages, during which the simple initial conditions seen with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) evolved into the complex structures we see today. A key process during the Dark Ages is the formation of the first (Pop III.1) stars in dark matter minihaloes with about 1-100 million times the mass of the sun at redshifts z~20-30.[1][2] These first, short-lived stars provided the universe with the heavy elements necessary for subsequent generations of stars and planets.

Besides providing heavy elements, the first stars impacted the intergalactic medium (IGM), transforming it from neutral hydrogen into the ionized state we see today. We can learn about first star formation by examining the all-sky (global) 21 cm brightness temperature (Tb) in the IGM. Prior to reionization Tb is is characterized by decrement followed by increment, which can be understood through the following process.

Lyman-alpha photons produced by the first stars couple the spin (Ts) and kinetic (Tk) temperature of the IGM through the Wouthuysen-Field mechanism.[3][4] Because Tk is well below the CMB temperature (Tg) at z~20-30, this coupling causes a decrement in Tb proportional to 1-Tg/Tk. Later the IGM is heated by x-rays or gamma-rays and Ts rises above Tg, ending the Tb trough. 

Observations of the Tb trough can be made by measurement of the 21 cm global spectrum.[5][6] The predicted depth (~ 0-300 mK), width (~ 0-50 MHz), and center frequency (~ 60-100 MHz) are all dependent on the model of first star formation. Measurement of the 21-cm global spectrum from 5-150 MHz would allow observers to investigate a large range of possible models of first star formation.

Several experiments seek to measure the Tb trough in the 21-cm global spectrum. These include the 'Large aperture Experiment to detect the Dark Ages' (LEDA) [7], an expanded EDGES [8], the 'LOFAR Cosmic Dawn Search' (LOCOS) [9][10], 'Sonda Cosmologica de las Islas para la deteccion de HIdrogeno neutro' (SCI-HI) [11], and the proposed 'Dark Ages Radio Explorer' (DARE) [12]. 

Current experiments are limited by atmospheric effects and terrestrial radio frequency interference (RFI). On the low frequency end, the maximum usable frequency (MUF) for AM radio directly traces the frequency at which the atmosphere blocks signals from the sky. At mid-latitudes the MUF is generally above 30-40 MHz, limiting observations. However, at polar latitudes the MUF can be as low as 5 MHz; allowing observations to be made to lower frequencies and higher redshifts. 

At some higher frequencies, experiments are limited by RFI from a number of sources. These include the FM radio band (88-108 MHz), where signals from local stations are larger than the signal from the sky. Signals from FM stations fall off as 1/r^2, so increasing the distance from any FM stations makes observations in this band possible. Testing with the SCI-HI experiment on Isla Guadalupe, about 250 km from the nearest radio sources, has demonstrated the possibility of observation in remote locations. Marion and Gough islands, located much further from the nearest coast (about 1500-2500 km), should provide an excellent RFI environment for radio experiments.
