"Probing the Dark Ages at z ~ 20: The SCI-HI 21 cm All-sky Spectrum
Experiment" - Voytek, Natarajan, Jauregui-Garcia, Peterson, and
Lopez-Cruz, ApJL 782, 9 (2014).  Initial results from the SCI-HI
experiment, which we would deploy to Marion and Gough as part of this
proposal.  This shows the need to go to extremely remote islands. 

"Submillimeter Site Testing at Dome C, Antarctica" - Calisse et
al. (inc. Peterson), PASA 21, 256 (2004).  Example of Peterson's
experience testing suitability of remote and harsh sites for
suitability of astronomical research.  

"An intensity map of hydrogen 21-cm emission at redshift z~0.8" -
Chang, Pen, Bandura, and Peterson, Nature 466, 463 (2010).  First
detection of atomic hydrogen at high redshift, which has now spawned
an industry within astrophysics.  

"Detection of B-Mode Polarization in the Cosmic Microwave Background
with Data from the South Pole Telescope" - Hanson et al. (including
Chiang), PRL 111, 1301 (2013).  First detection of B-modes in the CMB
using data collected by Chiang while wintering over at the South Pole.

"The Cosmic Background Imager" - Padin et al. (including Sievers),
PASP 114, 83 (2002).  Instrument paper describing the Cosmic
Background Imager, a radio telescope Sievers helped build and deploy
to 5000m in the Chilean Atacama.

"The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: cosmological parameters from three
seasons of data" - Sievers et al., JCAP 10, 60 (2013).  Main results
paper from another telescope at >5000m, cited nearly 200 times in the
year since it has been published.
