Presumably here we would talk about the SCI-HI project? Are there any other
projects that are direct precursors? Jeff ’s RFI site testing experience? CoI
previous antarctic experience?

<<<<<<< HEAD

The 'Sonda Cosmologica de las Islas para la deteccion de HIdrogeno neutro' (SCI-HI) experiment is an ongoing project led by CoI Jeffrey Peterson. This experiment has successfully made preliminary measurements of the 21 cm global spectrum from 60-90 MHz, providing modest constraints. This project is a direct precourser to the proposed project. The experiment design and data analysis provide a template which can be expanded in future experiments. 

Both CoI Jeffrey Peterson and CoI Cynthia Chang have extensive experience with Antarctic expeditions (with a total of over 20 visits including one winter over between them). 

CoI Jeffrey Peterson has also previously made evalutions of site viability; including measurements at the South Pole. 

=======
The proposing team are experts in the field, and will be substantially
repeating work they have done in the past with SCI-HI.  The unique,
ultra-remoteness of Marion and Gough means that the same experiment
could yield dramatically better data, and if successful, would be a
major discovery.  PI Sievers is an expert in data analysis, and co-I's
Chiang and Peterson are skilled hardware builders.  In addition, they
have extensive experience working in polar conditions, with Peterson
and Chiang having 20 South Pole deployments (including one
winter-over) between them, and Sievers and Peterson also have
extensive experience deploying and running experiments in the harsh
Chilean Andes at altitudes above 5000 metres.
