Presumably here we would talk about the SCI-HI project? Are there any other
projects that are direct precursors? Jeff ’s RFI site testing experience? CoI
previous antarctic experience?


The 'Sonda Cosmologica de las Islas para la deteccion de HIdrogeno neutro' (SCI-HI) experiment is an ongoing project led by CoI Jeffrey Peterson. This experiment has successfully made preliminary measurements of the 21 cm global spectrum from 60-90 MHz, providing modest constraints. This project is a direct precourser to the proposed project. The experiment design and data analysis provide a template which can be expanded in future experiments. 

Both CoI Jeffrey Peterson and CoI Cynthia Chang have extensive experience with Antarctic expeditions (with a total of over 20 visits including one winter over between them). 

CoI Jeffrey Peterson has also previously made evalutions of site viability; including measurements at the South Pole.
