The proposing team are experts in the field, and will be substantially
repeating work they have done in the past with SCI-HI.  The unique,
ultra-remoteness of Marion and Gough means that the same experiment
could yield dramatically better data, and if successful, would be a
major discovery.  PI Sievers is an expert in data analysis, and co-I's
Chiang and Peterson are skilled hardware builders.  In addition, they
have extensive experience working in polar conditions, with Peterson
and Chiang having 20 South Pole deployments (including one
winter-over) between them, and Sievers and Peterson also have
extensive experience deploying and running experiments in the harsh
Chilean Andes at altitudes above 5000 metres.
