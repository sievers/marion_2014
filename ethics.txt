Â°	 Provide an indication of any ethical implications and / or legislative compliance requirements of the proposed research and detail how these requirements have been / will be met.

We do not expect to have any ethical considerations.  The proposed
work leaves no permanent infrastructure, emits neither sound nor light, and should have no impact on
wildlife.  While we ideally hope to deploy SCI-HI to various locations
on the islands, if that present difficulties, the experiments can be
carried out from the station grounds if we can have the requested
radio-quiet times.
