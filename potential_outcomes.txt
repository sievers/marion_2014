Evaluation of Marion and Gough islands as potential sites for low frequency radio astronomy applications would provide visibility for South Africa as a site for future projects in this field.. 

Currently, the experiments studying the 21-cm global spectrum include collaborations from a wide range of international locations including the United States, the European Union and Australia. Demonstration of South African sites as optimal for this type of study would provide visibility at a global level and could lead to future projects at the sites. 

Publication of scientific results and site measurements from the proposed project would help to increase visibility to the larger community.
