°	This section includes the workplan which should focus on research activities and their associated milestones.
°	 Description should also include information on timeframes and responsibilities, how students will be involved, availability of specialized equipment, infrastructure and resources and other relevant information.

Timeline:
2014-2015 season: Trip to islands for preliminary site testing and
deployment of previously built experiment (SCI-HI). Would be the 2
week (?) turnaround period at one of the islands.

2015: Development and testing of new 21-cm experiment (multiple
antennae, better data collection hardware/software, possibly interferometry).

2015-2016 season: Deployment of new experiment to Marion

2016: Experiment improvements/repairs and analysis of 2015-2016 season data.

2016-2017 season: Deployment of updated experiment to Gough (order of
island visits can be swapped if logistically necessary).

2017: Analysis of 2016-2017 season data.


Equipment: 

Radio antennae (specially designed and built by
collaboration). Electronics (calibration, amplifiers, filters,
etc. either commercially available or developed by the
collaboration). Data Processing Hardware and Software (ADC, Fourier
transform, low power consumption, CASPER type gpu boards?). Data
analysis machines (Access to computer cluster for data analysis and
storage). Project data products should scale to about 100 Gb to 1 Tb
in size. Experiment development hardware (eg portable Vector Network
Analyzer, Spectrum Analyzer). Deployment resources (eg power
generators, batteries).

Student Involvement: 

There are opportunities for student involvement
at each stage of the project. In the experiment development and
testing phase, students will help to build and test each experiment
component locally. This includes antenna design and testing, gpu
programming, electronics component development and testing, and data
analysis code development (including simulation work). During
deployment students will help with data collection, including setup
and maintenance of the system. After deployment, students will help
with data analysis and system improvements, including developing
system improvements based upon deployment experience.
