We propose study the birth of the first stars in the universe, using
low-frequency (<150 MHz) observations.  The first stars were radically
different from the ones we see today, and so we understand very little
about the universe during their era, just a few hundred million years
after the big bang.  One of the best ways of studying them is by using
the 21-cm emission line of neutral hydrogen.  Today, their emission
has been redshifted by the expansion of the universe to low (<150 MHz)
frequencies.  Perhaps the key challenge in carrying out these
observations is radio frequency interference (RFI) from man-made
sources, which can swamp the desired signal even when hundreds of
kilometres away from the nearest sources of RFI.  The sub-Antarctic
islands provide a unique opportunity to see the first stars due to
their extreme remoteness, 2000+ km from the nearest continental
landmasses.  We propose to deploy SCI-HI, and instrument designed to
make this measurement, for short periods to Gough and Marion to determine their
suitability for studies of the first stars.  SCI-HI has already been
deployed to Guadalupe Island 200 km off the coast of Mexico, where RFI
was an order of magnitude larger than the expected astronomical
signal.  If initial results are promising, we propose to build a
follow-on experiment at the most promising site that would take data
over the course of a winter, possibly seeing the global signal from
the first time ever, letting us learn how the universe lit up.
Further, ionospheric conditions during the winter may mean we can
measure, for the first time, the universe during the dark ages that
lasted from shortly after the big bang until the formation of the
first stars.  The extreme remoteness of the islands provides a unique
geographical advantage for this work, which would be impossible to do
from virtually anywhere else on the planet.
