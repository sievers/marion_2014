"State the main research question or problem statement."

The primary goals for this proposal are two fold.

First, to test the islands (Marion, Gough) for suitability in low frequency radio astronomy applications. In particular, to investigate the Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) environment on the islands over the course of the year in the frequency range of 5-150 MHz.

Second, to develop and deploy a simple radio telescope system for measurement of the global hydrogen 21-cm signal in the same frequency range (5-150 MHz).
